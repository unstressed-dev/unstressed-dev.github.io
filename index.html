               I'm a sophomore from Brooklyn Technical High School, and aspire
               to be a Electrical Engineer and Researcher in conductive
               biomaterials. I am a student researcher of the BTHS Weston
               Research Scholars Program, interested in studying the material
               properties of synthetically produced Ampullae of Lorenzini
               hydrogels, and their applications in bioelectronics. I am also an
               amateur programmer, aiming to develop skills in C++, Python, and
               web development, as well as an active member of the BTHS Math
               Team.
